### **Summary**

```
The rapid buildout of AI data centers in the U.S. is straining the power grid, creating a large gap between demand and supply as tech giants explore behind-the-meter generation.
A Chinese research team released NEO, a native multimodal architecture that unifies vision and language and achieves strong results with far less training data.
Alibaba shipped Qwen Code v0.3.0 to improve developer workflows and security, while Nubia highlighted the rise of AI phones and its “AI for All” strategy.

### **Today's AI News**

1. **U.S. AI data center expansion is putting major pressure on the power grid**: A *Financial Times* analysis says the rapid growth of **AI data centers** is stressing the U.S. **power grid**. By 2028, AI could add roughly **44 GW** of electricity demand, but due to aging infrastructure and long permitting cycles, the grid may only supply about **25 GW**, leaving a gap of nearly **40%**. Big tech plans to invest hundreds of billions in data centers; OpenAI’s CEO reportedly called **power shortages** an existential threat. Some companies are exploring “behind-the-meter” generation such as natural-gas turbines. OpenAI also warned the U.S. has fallen behind China on power infrastructure buildout.

2. **Open-source NEO: a native multimodal architecture that unifies vision and language**: Against the backdrop of calls (including from Ilya Sutskever) to move beyond “scale-only” progress toward smarter architectures, a Chinese research team introduced **NEO**, an open-source **native multimodal** model that unifies vision and language in a single framework rather than stitching separate components together. NEO’s three core breakthroughs—**native patch embedding**, **native 3D rotary positional encoding**, and **native multi-head attention**—enable deep fusion of modalities. The team reports NEO matches or even surpasses flagship competitors on multiple evaluations while training with only **one-tenth** the data, pointing to a potential new direction for **AI model development**.

3. **Alibaba releases Qwen Code v0.3.0, a CLI AI workflow tool optimized for Qwen3-Coder**: Alibaba’s Tongyi Qwen announced **Qwen Code v0.3.0**, a command-line AI workflow tool tailored for Qwen3-Coder. The update upgrades four areas: new **Stream JSON mode** to improve automated workflows; one-click CN/EN UI switching plus support for custom language packs; improved safety and stability via stronger **memory-safety mechanisms** and cross-platform encoding fixes; and better ecosystem adaptation—delivering a more robust developer tool for global users.

4. **Nubia on “Doubao phone assistant” preview: AI phones are the next industry trend**: Nubia president Ni Fei addressed attention around the “Nubia M153 Doubao phone assistant” tech preview. He argued that the smartphone industry faces slowing innovation and that **AI phones** will be a major future trend. Nubia chose open collaboration with the Doubao assistant to improve the user experience and reiterated its long-running **“AI for All”** direction since 2017. The M153’s integration is framed as an important milestone in continuous AI innovation and all-scenario adoption. Ni also said Nubia is actively working with partners to resolve user-reported issues and will continue focusing on user experience while advancing “AI for All” together with the industry and users.
