### **Today's AI News**

1. **Doubao phone assistant tightens controls on AI automation features**: The **Doubao phone assistant** announced it will standardize and restrict some **AI-driven phone automation** capabilities after controversy over operating third-party apps on users’ behalf (including reports of limitations when interacting with apps like WeChat). Doubao emphasized all actions require user authorization, but said it will tighten certain behaviors to balance experimentation with industry rules. The update primarily restricts three scenarios: automated actions that **farm scores/rewards** inside apps; AI operation of **financial apps** such as banking and payments; and AI operation support for some **competitive games**—as the industry explores governance boundaries and rule frameworks.

2. **Microsoft releases VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B: lightweight, low-latency text-to-speech**: Microsoft introduced **VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B**, a lightweight real-time **TTS** model focused on **low latency** and **high naturalness**. It can start generating speech while receiving text, with the first audio segment in under **0.3 seconds**. With ~0.5B parameters, it can generate up to **90 minutes** of fluent speech, simulate natural dialogue among up to **four roles**, and express emotions. Its efficiency enables real-time runs on consumer GPUs, making it suitable for **voice assistants**, livestream narration, and similar applications.

3. **Xiaomi accelerates its foundation-model strategy and talent hiring**: **Xiaomi** is speeding up its push into **foundation models**. Executive Lu Weibing said the company has increased AI investment over recent quarters and is actively recruiting top talent—reportedly willing to offer compensation packages in the tens of millions of RMB. The joining of **Luo Fuli** (a key member from the **DeepSeek** founding team) is seen as a major strategic move. Xiaomi aims to lead not only in AI features across products, but also in **model and algorithm R&D** to improve users’ **smart living** experience.

4. **Harvard youth poll: 59% of young Americans worry AI could hurt employment prospects**: A new **Harvard youth poll** found **59%** of U.S. young adults aged 18–29 worry **AI** may harm their **job prospects**, including 26% who see a “serious” threat—greater than concerns about outsourcing and immigration. Despite the anxiety, 35% use **AI tools** often, while 63% have never used them. Looking ahead, 41% believe AI will make work feel less meaningful, and 44% fear career opportunities will shrink.

5. **OpenAI adds GPT-5.1-CodexMax to the Responses API for agentic coding workflows**: **OpenAI** announced its newest and most capable agentic coding model **GPT-5.1-CodexMax** is now fully available through the **Responses API**, allowing developers to embed top-tier capabilities for task decomposition, high-quality code generation, and autonomous execution directly into apps and workflows. Users who previously accessed CodexCLI via API keys also received access. OpenAI said the goal is to lower integration barriers so more products can offer an “always-on” coding assistant that writes, fixes, and executes autonomously.
