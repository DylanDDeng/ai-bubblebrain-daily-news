### **Today's AI News**

1. **Apple's AI strategy pivots toward Gemini integration and hardware leverage**. With Siri upgrades delayed and Apple Intelligence rollout slowing, reports suggest Apple plans to integrate Google Gemini into some AI features in 2026 rather than fully rely on in-house models. Internal debate over the cost of large-model R&D appears to be pushing Apple toward pragmatic integration and experience optimization. Apple's hardware ecosystem (especially iPhone) remains a core advantage for delivering AI features. After the prior AI lead retired, a Vision Pro veteran took over, hinting at convergence between spatial computing and AI.

2. **December multimodal benchmark: Gemini-3-Pro leads, Chinese models shine**. In the SuperCLUE-VLM December evaluation, Google's Gemini-3-Pro ranked first with 83.64. SenseNova V6.5Pro and ByteDance's Doubao Vision scored 75.35 and 73.15, while Alibaba's Qwen3-vl became the first open-source model to exceed 70. OpenAI's GPT-5.2 (high) ranked lower than expected, underscoring intensifying competition in multimodal vision.

3. **Alibaba launched MAI-UI, a foundation GUI agent family**. Built on Qwen3VL, MAI-UI takes natural language and UI screenshots to generate structured actions (clicks, input) and can execute in real-time Android environments. It integrates MCP tool calls, device-cloud collaboration, and online RL. On MobileWorld and AndroidWorld benchmarks, MAI-UI reportedly surpassed Gemini 2.5 Pro, marking progress in mobile GUI agents.

4. **Luo Yonghao on AI-generated content: a viral comment sparks unease**. At a 2025 tech innovation forum, Luo shared a deeply reasoned, eloquent review of his podcast "Luo Yonghao's Crossroads" and revealed it was generated by AI from a simple instruction. He described the result as chilling and said humans may be replaced, reigniting debate over AI's ability to emulate cultural insight and what remains uniquely human.

5. **Deep review of Loomi: an IDE-style approach to content creation**. After evaluating hundreds of AI writing tools, Loomi stood out for its "content engineering" model: an integrated workspace for research, web search, file organization, and production. It emphasizes "research before writing," supports precise editing of long documents, batch sync across files, and version tracing. The product frames writing like programming, aiming to replace "black box" generation with controllable, modular workflows.

6. **Tencent Hunyuan open-sourced Translation Model v1.5 with better on-device performance**. The release includes 1.8B and 7B sizes. The 1.8B model runs offline with about 1GB of memory after quantization and reportedly outperforms major APIs in speed while approaching large closed-model quality. It supports 33 global languages plus 5 domestic minority languages, adds custom terminology, context handling, and format preservation, and uses distillation to pass big-model capabilities to smaller models.

7. **Claude Code goes visual with a workflow editor**. The community-built "Claude Code Workflow Studio" VSCode extension offers a drag-and-drop canvas to build AI automations without complex prompts or terminal commands. Users can assemble nodes for prompts, agents, and conditional branches, edit via natural language, and manage multi-step workflows like summarization and code review. The tool is available on GitHub and the VSCode Marketplace and signals a shift from CLI-only tooling to accessible visual automation.
