> `AI Daily Brief`

### **Summary**

```
AI21Labs said it has no specific deal with Nvidia, while Xiaomi extended the MiMo-V2-Flash public beta and announced pricing. Moonshot AI closed a USD 500M Series C and plans to boost employee incentives instead of rushing to IPO. YuanLab.ai open-sourced a multimodal foundation model, and Tencent Hunyuan released a text-to-3D motion generation model.
Analysts argue AI wrapper products must embed deeply into workflows, while OpenAI's employee stock compensation hit a record high. A new analysis says the AI intelligence growth bottleneck is not compute, but the inability of current paradigms to efficiently convert more compute into capability.

### **Today's AI News**

1. **AI21Labs CEO Ori Goshen told staff there is no concrete deal with Nvidia**. The company is in confidential talks with multiple partners including Nvidia, but discussions remain ongoing and do not imply imminent changes. AI21Labs said operations are stable and promised transparency if anything material happens.

2. **Xiaomi extended the free public beta of MiMo-V2-Flash by 20 days**, now ending at 2:00 pm on Jan 20, 2026. MiMo-V2-Flash is an open-source model with 309B parameters. Xiaomi also announced API pricing: CNY 0.7 per million input tokens and CNY 2.1 per million output tokens for domestic users, and USD 0.1 / USD 0.3 per million tokens for overseas users.

3. **Moonshot AI completed a USD 500M Series C**, lifting cash reserves above RMB 10 billion. CEO Yang Zhilin said the company is not rushing to IPO and can invest in long-cycle R&D. It plans to double employee incentives in 2026 and aims to compete with global AGI leaders.

4. **YuanLab.ai open-sourced the Yuan3.0Flash multimodal foundation model**. The 40B-parameter model uses a sparse mixture-of-experts architecture that activates about 3.7B parameters at inference, reducing compute cost. The team released multiple weight variants and technical reports, and claimed performance above GPT-5.1 in several enterprise tasks at 25% to 50% of the cost. More versions from 40B to 1T parameters are planned.

5. **Tencent Hunyuan open-sourced HY-Motion1.0, a text-to-3D motion model**. The 10B-parameter Diffusion Transformer model generates high-quality 3D skeleton animations from a single text prompt and supports import into mainstream 3D tools. It covers 200+ actions across six categories and reportedly outperforms open baselines in instruction following and motion quality. A lightweight version is also open-sourced.

6. **An analysis argues that AI wrapper products must embed deeply into workflows to survive**. The piece distinguishes "feature" apps easily replaced by platform capabilities from "product" apps that build durable moats. Startups face a double bind: dependence on foundation models while competing with platforms for distribution. The conclusion is that successful wrappers must solve real workflow problems, not just offer thin tools.

7. **OpenAI's employee stock compensation hit a record high**, averaging USD 1.5 million for about 4,000 employees. That is roughly 34x the pre-IPO year compensation of 18 major tech companies over the past 25 years. Estimates suggest OpenAI could pay USD 3 billion per year in stock comp before 2030. The company also removed vesting requirements, which may further raise compensation to attract talent.

8. **A new analysis says AI intelligence growth is bottlenecked by paradigm limits, not compute**. NUS professor You Yang argued that intelligence is the ability to predict future states and bear consequences. Transformers succeeded partly because they map well onto GPU-style parallelism. The challenge is finding architectures or objectives that convert added compute into stable capability gains, with potential directions including higher-precision compute, improved optimizers, and more scalable architectures.
