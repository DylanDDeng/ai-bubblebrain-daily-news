### **Today's AI News**

1.  The tech circle has been incredibly lively recently, as if **AI** giants have collectively entered an **"overdrive" mode**, continuously dropping **heavy bombs**, signaling that we are one step closer to a future where **"AI is ubiquitous"**!

2.  First, Google unveiled their secret weapon – the first **text embedding model**, **gemini-embedding-001**. What does this thing do? Simply put, it's like an "interpreter" in the AI world, capable of "translating" human text into **digital vectors** that computers can understand. This means AI can comprehend your every word more precisely, instantly understanding your intent whether it's for search, classification, or Q&A! What's even more impressive is that it supports **over 100 languages** and is exceptionally flexible, allowing the output "translation results" to be adjusted in precision according to your needs. It's like translation software that not only offers literal translations but also various styles of interpretation. Furthermore, it directly soared to **first place** in the authoritative industry **MTEB** evaluation, truly an "ace student"! In the future, your **smart search** will understand you better, and various applications will be able to achieve **semantic search**, bridging communication gaps in the world.

3.  Subsequently, the **video creation** domain also welcomed a "revolution." Runway released its new generation **motion capture model**, **Act-Two**, which is simply a blessing for animators and content creators! In the past, making characters lifelike required wearing those "high-tech bodysuits" covered with dense sensors, which was time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. Now, **Act-Two** tells you there's no need! You just need to record a performance video with your phone and provide AI with a reference character, and it can help you achieve **full-body tracking**. Even details like **subtle facial expressions** and **finger tracking** can be perfectly captured, **without professional equipment**! This means the barrier to entry for everything from **AI video generation** to animation production and game development has been significantly lowered, giving everyone a chance to be a "director." Imagine, in the future, you casually record a dance video, and AI can transform your moves into exclusive dances for anime characters or fantasy creatures—it's truly a creative explosion!

4.  Finally, the most sci-fi and thought-provoking development has arrived – the **AI operating system**, **NeuralOS**, brought by a Chinese team! This is not a simple software upgrade; it aims to overturn our conventional **human-computer interaction** methods. It can **perfectly simulate the Windows interface**, but at its core is a "mind-reading" AI. Through **recurrent neural networks (RNN)** and a **diffuse neural renderer (Renderer)**, it can predict your next action in real-time, even quietly preparing before you click. It's like your computer has a "sixth sense," always one step ahead of you, proactively presenting what you need. This **open-source** system, though still being optimized, already offers a glimpse into the future of operating systems: they will no longer be cold buttons and menus but "live" interfaces dynamically generated based on your habits. While this brings extreme convenience, it also makes one ponder: as AI understands us more and more, even predicting our behavior, will we enjoy this "attentiveness," or will we feel a hint of bewilderment at being "seen through"? Where does our **autonomy** lie?

5.  These **three technological breakthroughs**, from the dimensions of "understanding language," "giving life," and "intelligent interaction," respectively, depict a **new landscape of the AI era**. They are **milestones of technological progress** and also present us with new questions: Where will AI take us? Will the future bring more **freedom of creation** and a **more convenient life**, or will it lead to a life where we **rely more on AI**, or even one that is "arranged" by it? All these are worth waiting to see.

6.  Hey guys, **AI** is making big waves in the **programming world** again! Recently, two major pieces of news in the **tech circle** are like two **heavy bombs**, signaling that the future of **software development** might undergo a complete transformation!

7.  First, those flashy **AI programming tools**, like the familiar Copilot, are quietly "returning to simplicity," shifting their focus from dazzling graphical interfaces to what seems like an "old-fashioned" **command-line interface (terminal)**. This isn't a sudden whim but driven by new concepts like **"autonomous agent AI"** and **"vibe coding."** Think about it: as AI becomes smarter and smarter, it no longer just helps you write a few lines of code; it acts like a real "programmer," directly interacting with the **operating system**, compiling programs, and deploying services. At this point, the black-and-white screen that frequently appeared in 90s hacker movies—the **terminal**—becomes the **behind-the-scenes hero** for AI to flex its muscles.

8.  Does it feel counter-intuitive? But the data doesn't lie! Top labs like **Anthropic**, **DeepMind**, and **OpenAI** have successively launched their own **command-line AI tools**, and surprisingly, they have become the most popular products within their companies! Some experts even boldly predict that in the future, up to 95% of interactions between **large language models (LLM)** and computers will occur via the **terminal**. What's more disheartening is that a recent study found that programmers might have overestimated the **productivity improvement** offered by traditional AI code editors. While claiming a 20%-30% efficiency boost, the actual task completion speed was nearly 20% slower! This is quite a splash of cold water for those of us accustomed to sleek interfaces! But don't worry, this trend has also given rise to new stars like **Warp**, which focuses on **terminal tools** and is redefining efficiency by tackling more **hardcore, low-level development tasks**.

9.  Meanwhile, the **AI model field** has also exploded! An **open-source AI model** named **Kimi-2** has burst onto the scene, reportedly showing stunning performance in various tests, especially its **code generation capability**, which has surpassed GPT-4.1 and is closing in on the industry-leading Claude Opus 4! Even more impressively, its **agent capabilities** are on par with Google's top-tier Gemini model.

10. Not only does **Kimi-2** boast **powerful performance**, but its **price is also incredibly affordable**! At just $0.15 per million tokens, it's practically a bonus for developers! Coupled with its **open-source** nature, it undoubtedly injects a strong boost into the entire **AI ecosystem**, meaning more **innovative applications** will emerge based on Kimi-2 in the future.

11. So, you see, on one side, **AI programming tools** are transforming from "flashy and high-end" to "powerful and practical," moving towards a **more efficient**, **lower-level terminal**; on the other side, the "common hero" of **open-source AI models** has emerged, using incredible performance and ultra-low prices to **disrupt the status quo**. These two forces converging suggest that the future of **software development** will no longer be as simple as just writing code; it will become **smarter**, **more automated**, and even possess **"superpowers."** Are you ready?

12. Hey, fellow **tech explorers**! Today, let's not talk about anything else, but rather the latest eye-catching new **breakthroughs** and **tools** in the **tech circle** that can not only make your work smoother but also give us a glimpse into the infinite possibilities of the **future**!

13. First up are two **AI assistants**:
    *   **DocsGPT** (Released 2025-07-17):
        Imagine having a super reliable librarian living in your knowledge base. That's **DocsGPT**! It's an **open-source**, **generative AI tool** specifically designed to help you **get reliable answers** from various documents. The coolest part is its built-in "anti-deception" feature, which effectively helps **avoid hallucinations** (the AI's tendency to fabricate information). Moreover, it strongly emphasizes privacy, allowing you to **privately and reliably retrieve information**, and even includes an integrated **tool and agent system**. It's truly the best guardian for your private knowledge treasure trove! In the future, will it become each of our personal "knowledge housekeepers"? It's worth looking forward to!
    *   **claude-code** (Released 2025-07-17):
        If you're a coder or about to step into the programming world, then **claude-code** is definitely worth your attention! It's like your personal programming **agent**, residing directly in your **terminal**, capable of deeply **understanding your codebase**. Want to code faster? It can help you handle routine repetitive tasks, explain complex code that gives you headaches, and even manage your **Git workflow** through **natural language commands**. It truly integrates AI into your programming flow, making coding as natural as chatting. Will it be the "standard" for future programming? Just imagine, you tell it your requirements, and the code generates and optimizes itself—that efficiency would soar!

14. Next, let's turn our attention to an **important scientific breakthrough** concerning our **life safety**:

15. *   **Tianjin University and others develop chemical toxicity prediction model, published in Nature Communications** (Released 2025-07-16):
    Every year, up to 100,000 new chemical substances are introduced globally, but evaluating their toxicity, especially their impact on humans, is practically an "impossible mission"—because relevant data is incredibly scarce! Many traditional machine learning models face the dilemma of "a clever wife cannot cook without rice" in this regard, with some human toxicity data sets containing as few as 140 entries!

    However, a joint team including **Tianjin University** has solved this puzzle, much like Sherlock Holmes! They developed a brand-new **chemical toxicity prediction model**—the **ToxACoL framework**. What makes this system so powerful? It ingeniously employs **endpoint association graph modeling** and **accompanying bidirectional learning**, which not only "excavates" valuable information from extremely scarce data but also significantly improves prediction accuracy.

    The results are even more astonishing: for predicting the human oral **minimum toxic dose (TDLo)**, its performance improved by **56%** compared to state-of-the-art methods, and for female-specific data, it soared by **87%**! For particularly data-scarce toxicity endpoints, the required data volume was reduced by an impressive **70%-80%**—it's like achieving the most outstanding results with the least resources! This research achievement has been successfully published in the authoritative scientific journal, **Nature Communications**.

    Even better, to make it accessible to more researchers and institutions, the team has integrated **ToxACoL** into an **online web platform** and can even predict chemical **GHS classification** (the toxicity labeling system). This means that in the future, our identification and management of chemical safety will be more accurate and efficient! This is not just an academic breakthrough; it's a significant advancement that can genuinely **ensure our living safety**. Will it **expand to broader chemical tasks** in the future, even becoming the "industry standard" for chemical safety assessment? This is undoubtedly another splendid chapter of science benefiting humanity!

16. That's all for today's **tech news**! Don't you think the **charm of technology** is boundless? From your terminal to the lab, **AI** and **data** are **changing the world** in ways we can barely imagine. See you next time!

17. In the past six months, **AI** has truly epitomized "light-speed development"! From DeepSeek at the beginning of the year to Gemini and Claude, the "intelligence race" among **large models** has been fierce, with new tricks every month, making everyone feel left behind if they don't keep up with updates. But while running fast, we also need to consider if we're running steadily and in the right direction!

18. Recently, **Amazon Web Services** launched an "AI project manager"—**Kiro**! It's not one of those "**vibe coding**" tools that just churns out a half-baked product when you casually say "write some code," leaving you to clean up the mess. Kiro can help you transform vague requirements into **structured** **requirements specifications**, **technical designs**, and even break them down into **development tasks**, even considering **unit tests** for you! It also has a "**Hooks mechanism**," acting like your seasoned partner; when you modify code or save files, it automatically helps you update tests and check for security, saving you a lot of worry. Kiro's goal is to turn AI from a "temporary tool" into a true "**engineering collaborator**," or even a "**senior partner**." This is great; before, humans asked AI to write code, now AI is leading humans to do engineering!

19. However, when AI becomes this "smart" and "proactive," it also has a "small flaw"—**"lying" or "talking nonsense with a straight face."** Especially when encountering **unsolvable problems**, **large models** surprisingly **"crash,"** attempting to fabricate answers! This is no joke; it not only wastes resources but can also mislead users. To address this, **The Chinese University of Hong Kong** and **Huawei Noah's Ark Lab** jointly developed an "AI lie detector"—the **ReliableMath benchmark**. It's like setting a rule for AI: "**to know that you know, and to know that you don't know, that is true knowledge!**" (Knowing what you know, and admitting what you don't know, is true knowledge). This benchmark specifically evaluates whether large models, during mathematical reasoning, can "honestly" admit when a problem is unsolvable, rather than making things up. This "testing system" even includes deliberately tricky "unsolvable math problems" to test the AI's "reliability." It seems that making AI more "**reliable**" and "**trustworthy**" is a significant step in the future development of large models!

20. With technology progressing so rapidly, you must have many thoughts and confusions to discuss, right? No problem! As a top event in the **NLP field**, **ACL 2025** will be held from July 27th to August 1st in **Vienna, Austria**. This is the annual "Mount Hua Discussion" for NLP researchers! And **Machine Learning** has thoughtfully prepared a "**Cloud Sail · ACL 2025 AI Talent Meetup**" for everyone. Imagine, instead of just poring over papers, you can enjoy **fine wine and delicious food** while chatting about gossip, sharing the latest research with **AI elites** from all over the world, and even finding desirable job opportunities—isn't this much more interesting than staring blankly at a computer screen? This is truly an excellent opportunity for AI practitioners to openly "**meet up**," "**reconnect with old friends and make new ones**," and simultaneously capture **frontier technology** and **talent development trends**!

21. So you see, the future of AI must pursue both **efficiency and collaboration** (e.g., Kiro making AI a partner) and also **reliability and honesty** (e.g., ReliableMath enabling AI to "know what it doesn't know"), and it certainly cannot do without the collision and connection of our "human wisdom" (e.g., ACL's offline gathering). No matter how fast technology develops, don't forget to **exchange ideas face-to-face** with peers; perhaps the next inspiration lies within that glass of wine!

22. I heard **Mark Zuckerberg** is making another big move! **Meta** is reportedly investing heavily to build a **super data center**, so massive that it's practically the size of **Manhattan** Island! This embodies their latest round of **artificial intelligence (AI) ambition**.

23. This inevitably leads one to ponder: What will AI become when it starts "consuming" data on a scale larger than cities? Is our **digital future** hidden within these data centers, resembling **colossal farms**, where an unimaginable "**digital brain**" quietly grows? What unforeseen challenges will arise from the **resource demands** behind this, and the future **power concentration** of AI?
