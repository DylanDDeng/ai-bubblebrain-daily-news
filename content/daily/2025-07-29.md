### **Today's AI News**

1.  The tech world has been abuzz recently, with the **AI** wave thoroughly transforming how we use **tools**! From design to browsing, and even AI's own **"carbon footprint"** beginning to face public scrutiny, it's a magical reality where a sense of **future** coexists with a sense of **responsibility**.

2.  First, imagine being a designer without needing Photoshop! **Canva** and **Claude AI**, this new duo, have directly turned design from a "professional skill" into **"chat commands."** You just need to type "design a new product launch poster for me" in **Claude**'s chat box, and the **AI** will instantly understand your intent, helping you present a visual feast in **Canva**! Behind this is **Anthropic**'s **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, acting as a "translator," enabling **seamless dialogue** between AI and various applications. This isn't just about convenience; it's about lowering the creative threshold to the floor, truly realizing the vision of "**everyone can design**" and allowing non-professionals to easily create **professional-grade content**. From now on, your "flash of inspiration" will no longer be constrained by cumbersome software!

3.  Next, your browser is also "supercharged"! Microsoft's **Edge browser** has launched the explosive **Copilot mode**, directly transforming the browser from a passive tool into your **intelligent AI assistant**. What's most impressive is the **multi-tab RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** feature, which acts like a super scholar, helping you perform **deep analysis** and **summarize** the content of multiple tabs you have open simultaneously. For instance, when you're writing a thesis or conducting research, it can quickly extract **key information** and even compare different viewpoints. There's also the even cooler **Copilot Vision**, which can "see" the content on your screen. If you're looking at lipstick on an e-commerce site, it can immediately help you with **price comparison** and **recommend similar products**. Isn't this like bestowing the superpower of "seeing and hearing everything" directly upon the browser? In the future, browsing the internet won't be about you passively searching; instead, **information will actively come to you**, with an efficiency that makes you want to shout!

4.  However, behind AI's "magic," are there hidden "costs"? **Mistral AI**, a company from Paris, bravely peeled back a corner of AI's glossy exterior, performing an **"environmental check-up"** on its **Large Language Model Large2** for the first time and releasing a thought-provoking **environmental impact analysis** report. The study found that **AI models** are the biggest "energy hogs" during the **training and inference (i.e., when you chat with it)** phases, contributing **85.5% of greenhouse gas emissions** and **91% of water consumption**. Don't underestimate the "invisible consumption" of each chat. For example, every 400 characters you chat with **"Le Chat"** generate approximately **1.14 grams of CO2 emissions** and **45 milliliters of water consumption**. This makes us ponder: as we enjoy the convenience and efficiency brought by **AI**, should we also pay attention to its "invisible burden" on the planet? **Mistral AI**'s **transparency** is commendable, and it also calls on the entire **AI industry** to act, making **AI** "greener" as it rapidly develops. After all, Earth is our common "server"!

5.  In summary, **AI** is permeating every aspect of our lives at an unimaginable speed. It can be a "**powerful assistant**" for our creativity and productivity, yet also inadvertently leave a heavy "**environmental footprint**." How to balance **technological innovation** with **sustainable development**, allowing **AI** to both illuminate our lives and not deplete our future energy, is undoubtedly a major challenge for all tech companies and for each of us.

6.  Recently, the digital world's compass has shifted again! On one hand, **AI** is introducing new tricks in **image creation**, with **autoregressive models** making a comeback, vowing to challenge the popular **diffusion models**; on the other hand, our digital life housekeeper — the **Central Cyberspace Administration** — has begun to crack down heavily on **"self-media"** publishing **false information**, especially targeting the chaos of **AI-generated content**. Of course, there's also a thoughtful small upgrade: **NotebookLM**'s **"featured notebooks"** function has fully launched, allowing you to more conveniently access the **latest information**.

7.  First, let's talk about the "metaphysical" realm of **AI image generation**. While **Diffusion models** currently create excellent images, achieving **"pixel-level" precise control** or simultaneously understanding multiple inputs like text and images often leads to "deviations," and their training is **costly and time-consuming**. However, recently, "masters" from top research institutions like Tsinghua and Peking University have unleashed a big move: they've revived the long-dormant **Autoregressive model (AR)**, introducing a new framework called **MENTOR**. This guy is formidable; through a unique **"two-stage training method,"** it not only achieves **pixel-level precise control** and effectively solves the problem of "neglecting one thing for another" with **multi-modal input**, but also requires only **one-tenth** of the training data of diffusion models and is faster! It's simply a model of "**cost reduction and efficiency increase**." **MENTOR** achieves a remarkable balance of performance in **image reconstruction fidelity** and **multi-modal instruction following** with smaller model sizes and fewer training resources. Although **MENTOR** still has room for improvement in some extreme details, it undoubtedly opens up new avenues for **AI image creation**, demonstrating the immense potential of the **autoregressive paradigm** in the **visual generation** field. The future is promising!

8.  That said, **AI**, a double-edged sword, is art when used well, but troublesome when misused. The **Central Cyberspace Administration** has set its sights on "content black workshops" masquerading as **"self-media,"** **maliciously exploiting hot topics**, **forging data**, and even using **AI** to **synthesize fake news**. Starting from July 24, 2025, a **special rectification action** lasting two months will begin. The Cyberspace Administration requires major platforms to strengthen management: **mandatory labeling of information sources**, with no source, don't expect to enter the **algorithm recommendation pool**; **refine professional qualification certification processes**, no more allowing uncertified or falsely qualified "experts" to spout nonsense; and more importantly, to **optimize AI Generated Content (AIGC) identification functions**, so everyone can instantly recognize what **AI** has "concocted." This series of actions aims to make the online world less manipulative and more sincere, creating a **credible, orderly online environment** for the public.

9.  Of course, there are also positive technological developments. For instance, Google's **NotebookLM** has finally made its **"featured notebooks"** function fully available to everyone! Now, as soon as you log into the homepage, you can see the **latest, hottest news reports** in a **prominent position**, covering everything from **tech trends** to **industry dynamics**. This greatly simplifies the steps to obtain information, allowing users to **instantly access** curated content without additional operations. No more painstakingly searching for materials; you can **efficiently access information** anytime, anywhere, and it supports **multi-platform access**, providing a consistent, smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This is truly a thoughtful little helper for boosting efficiency!

10. Doesn't this series of news make you curious about the future of the digital world? From the battle over **AI model** technical routes to the **governance and standardization of online content**, and the popularization of **personalized information access tools**, we are in an era of rapid technological development and continuous rule refinement. The **AI** wave is surging forward, bringing infinite possibilities but also new challenges. As digital citizens, we should not only enjoy the convenience brought by technology but also keep our eyes open, learn to **discern information authenticity**, and jointly build a **"true, good, and beautiful" digital home**!

11. The second half of the **AI** battle is no longer about who has larger model parameters or better performance scores, but about who can truly "move" **AI** closer to you and me, transforming it from a aloof laboratory "nerd" into a "versatile partner" in life and work! The recent **WAIC (World Artificial Intelligence Conference)** has become the central showcase for this "implementation breakthrough," and our tech giants JD and Alibaba have thoroughly "figured out" the "roadmap" for deep **AI application**, each with their unique skills!

12. **JD: AI with a "Warm" Human Touch**
    JD has upgraded its large model brand to "**JoyAI**" (meaning "Enjoy AI"), a name that immediately evokes a sense of everyday life. Their **AI** is no longer cold technology; it's beginning to have a "**human touch**":
    *   **Digital Humans Take Center Stage, Outperforming Real Streamers!** Remember Liu Qiangdong's digital human live stream last year? Now, JD's **digital humans** are not just eye-catching "vases"; upgraded by **JoyAI**, their movements are more natural, and emotions richer. They can introduce products and conduct hands-on tests like real streamers, and during "618," their **sales performance even surpassed 80% of real streamers** on the market! This technology is so impressive that even high-end luxury brands are actively seeking them out, and they've won China's highest award in intelligent science and technology — the **Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Award Special Prize**. This isn't just a digital human; it's a "**digital sales elite**"!

13. **JoyInside: Infusing "Souls" into Smart Hardware!** JD's newly launched "**JoyInside**" smart platform, as its name suggests, sounds a bit mystical. In reality, it aims to inject AI's "wisdom" and "emotional intelligence" into hardware like **robots** and **smart toys**, enabling them not only to move but also to chat with you, remember your preferences, and become a "**warm companion**"! Imagine your little toy not only being cute but also being able to "give advice" when you're stressed from overtime. Isn't this like science fiction's "intelligent cuddly pets" coming to life? Currently, **over ten enterprises** have connected to **JoyInside**, including **companion dolls**, **chess robots**, and even **industrial humanoid robots and robot dogs**, transforming them from mere "tool-humans" that only execute commands into beings with "**high-EQ souls**."

14. **JoyAgent: AI Agents' "Internal Practice" and "External Openness"!** The reason JD's **AI** can be so "down-to-earth" so quickly is because it has been "honed" in its vast retail and logistics **supply chain scenarios**. Internally, they already have **over 20,000 agents** at work, undertaking **over 18% of the company's work content**. Now, JD has also **open-sourced** these "battle-tested" **JoyAgent** platforms. Whether you're an **individual developer**, a **start-up company**, or an **enterprise-level developer**, you can "take and use" them to quickly achieve **intelligent upgrade**. This move is like sharing their own "secret sauce" to collectively "raise the bar."

15. **Alibaba: From "Movie-Grade Art" to "Proactive Cockpit"**
    Alibaba has also created new wonders in the "second half" of **AI**, not only pursuing "artistic flair" in technology but also "driving" **AI** into cars:
    *   **Wan2.2: The World's First MoE Video Generation Model, Packed with Cinematic Feel!** Alibaba recently **open-sourced** a video generation model called "**Wan2.2**," touted as the **global first MoE architecture video generation model**. Its most impressive feature is its ability to produce videos with "**movie-level aesthetic effects**." Everything from **lighting, composition, and color** can be precisely controlled, generating 720P, 24fps **HD video** that can even run on **ordinary graphics cards**. This is like embedding a film director's "shot list" and "artistic aesthetic" into the **AI**'s "brain," allowing ordinary people to generate a blockbuster feel with **"one-click blockbuster generation."**

16. **Banma Zhixing: Turning Cars into "Proactively Thinking" AI Robots!** Alibaba's **Banma Zhixing** also shone brightly this time. Its equipped **Yuan Shen AI large model** achieved **all-item first** in international evaluation agencies for **smart cockpit capability assessment**, considered to have initially achieved **L3-level cockpit capability**, practically an "honor student" in intelligent cockpits. **Banma Zhixing**, in collaboration with Alibaba's **Tongyi large model**, directly embeds **AI capabilities** into cars, allowing the vehicle not only to **understand your speech** but also to "**proactively think**." For example, it can turn on the AC based on your state, recommend music in traffic, or even order coffee in the car with a single sentence, with the **robot** delivering it directly to your vehicle! Isn't this like moving Musk's envisioned "intelligent restaurant" into the car? This not only demonstrates Alibaba's advantages in **software and hardware integration** but also takes Chinese automotive "**smart wisdom**" to the world stage.

17. In conclusion, whether it's **JD's "warm" digital humans and robots** or **Alibaba's "movie-grade" video generation and "proactively thinking" smart cars**, they all tell us that **AI** is no longer an ivory tower; it is permeating every aspect of our lives in various vivid and interesting ways, truly becoming an indispensable "**good helper**" by our side, making technology more interesting and convenient! The "deep application" breakthrough battle of **AI** has just begun!

18. "My **AI bill** is already **$350** this month, and I feel like I'll miss the 'good old days' now!" Reddit user **DavidCBlack**'s **image post**, though brief, echoed the sentiments of many. This **AI** was originally meant to save us time and effort, but as we use it, the **bill** keeps skyrocketing! If **$350** already hurts, what will happen in the future when **AI** is ubiquitous in every household and permeates every aspect of work and life? Will its **usage cost** become our new major "**monthly payment**"? It seems that while enjoying the convenience of **AI**, we must also begin to consider: Is this **AI craze** really **saving us money**, or is it quietly becoming a **new burden** on our wallets? In the future, will **AI freedom** become a luxury item?
