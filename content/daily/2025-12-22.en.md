### **Today's AI News**

1. **San Francisco power outage paralyzes Waymo robotaxis, exposing autonomous driving's infrastructure dependency**: On evening of December 21 local time, a large-scale power outage in San Francisco due to a substation fire caused Waymo's Robotaxi service to be completely paralyzed, with many driverless cars stopping in middle of roads, causing severe congestion. Waymo suspended service but didn't explain specific reason. Analysis suggests this may be due to vehicles' V2X traffic signal systems, cellular networks, or remote operation centers failing due to outage. This incident exposes the high dependency of Level 4 autonomous driving on urban digital infrastructure, warning's industry to build a more resilient "vehicle-road-cloud-power" integrated system.

2. **OpenAI's key internal metric "compute margin" reached 70% as of October 2025**, significantly higher than end of 2024. This metric reflects the profit margin of AI service revenue after deducting model operating costs. Efficiency improvements mainly came from model inference optimization, effectiveness of self-developed computing power layout, and an increase in high-value user proportion. This marks significant enhancement of OpenAI's core AI service profitability and may drive entire industry into a new competition phase of "efficiency first."

3. **Alibaba Qwen recently released its "2025 Top 10 AI Prompts" list, revealing high-frequency user scenarios**: "Stock analysis" ranked first, reflecting AI has become an important tool for stock investors. Following closely were "Ba Zi" (Chinese astrology) and "emotional counseling." The list also included moments copy, insomnia, divorce property division, and even "meaning of life," showing users are applying AI to areas ranging from life assistant to complex decision assistance and emotional comfort.

4. **Latest benchmark tests from AI research organization METR show that Anthropic's top model Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrated dominance in handling ultra-long-duration tasks**: While maintaining a 50% success rate, the model could continuously handle complex tasks lasting approximately 4 hours and 49 minutes, setting a new industry record. Tests revealed the model's endurance limits at different difficulty levels, with advantages particularly evident in high-difficulty tasks. Although sample size was small and there were concerns about targeted optimization, this breakthrough marks AI transitioning from "short-instruction responder" to "long-horizon project executor."

5. **Google recently launched an open standard called A2UI (Agent-to-User Interface)**, aiming to give AI agents the ability to instantly create graphical user interfaces. The standard uses Apache 2.0 license, with core functionality enabling AI to dynamically generate interface elements like forms and buttons based on conversation context, replacing lengthy traditional pure-text interactions and greatly improving efficiency. A2UI works by transmitting structured data rather than executable code, balancing safety and flexibility, and is platform-independent. The standard is already in production use with multi-party support, potentially reshaping AI application user experience.

6. **On December 20, National AI Application Pilot Base (Medical) in Zhejiang released "Anzhen'er Medical Large Model" jointly developed by Ant Group**: The model has 100 billion parameters, making it the world's largest open-source medical large model. It uses a Mixture-of-Experts architecture and fully supports domestic chips. Unlike general models, Anzhen'er is based on massive medical data, with multi-turn reasoning and clinical diagnostic assistance capabilities. Currently, the model has achieved clinical deployment in two scenarios: post-cardiac surgery health management and adolescent mental health counseling. Meanwhile, Zhejiang launched the "Anzhen'er Open Source Community," opening model weights and toolchain globally to build an open medical AI ecosystem.

7. **Samsung Electronics announced it will launch in the U.S. before CES next month a Bespoke AI refrigerator powered by Google Gemini's large model**: The fridge has built-in high-precision cameras and uses AI vision to not only automatically recognize dozens of ingredients (including packaged foods and leftovers), but also recommend recipes and generate shopping lists. Its features extend to wine management, able to scan labels to identify wine information and generate lists. This collaboration marks large model technology deeply penetrating high-value appliances, driving smart homes from "remote control" to "proactive service."

8. **Kuaishou recently upgraded its AI video generator Kling to version 2.6**, adding two core features: voice control and motion control. Voice control can not only generate sound effects, human voices, and music matching the video, but also supports users uploading their own voice for customization to maintain voice consistency across videos. For motion control, the system can more accurately capture and process complex full-body movements like dance or martial arts, and improved hand movements and lip-sync accuracy. The service is provided through proprietary and third-party platforms, with competitive market pricing.

9. **Alibaba's Qwen team released a revolutionary image editing model Qwen-Image-Layered**: The model can intelligently decompose static photos into multiple independent RGBA layers with transparent backgrounds, giving images structured editability similar to Photoshop files. Users can independently and non-destructively edit specific layers—scaling, moving, changing colors, or deleting—without affecting other parts of the image. The model's code has been open-sourced on GitHub and other platforms.

10. **Chinese AGI startup MiniMax passed Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing hearing on December 21**, potentially becoming the fastest AI technology company from founding to IPO. The company demonstrates extremely high financial efficiency, holding over $1 billion in cash as of end of September 2025, with cumulative R&D spending of only about $500 million. Its shareholders include Alibaba, Tencent, miHoYo, Xiaohongshu, Hillhouse Capital, and Sequoia China. The company has built a product matrix covering both C-end and B-end markets, including apps like Hailuo AI and Talkie.

11. **At Volcano Engine Force conference, President Tan Dai stated that Agents are becoming the core carrier for AI implementation**: He pointed out that large model applications are moving from Q&A-style interaction into complex industry scenarios, and packaging models as stable, scalable Agents is the current industry bottleneck. To address this, Volcano Engine officially released AgentKit, a framework for developing and running agents with full-link components including task planning, tool calling, and security sandbox, aimed at lowering development barriers. Tan Dai predicted agents will become the "new compute unit" of the AI era, emphasizing that safety capabilities need to be deeply embedded throughout the Agent lifecycle.

12. **Google open-sourced the A2UI (Agent-to-User Interface) project**, aiming to let AI agents automatically generate safe, interactive graphical user interfaces (UI). Traditional AI directly outputting HTML/JS code poses security risks and cross-platform compatibility issues. A2UI's solution is to define an open UI description standard, having AI generate declarative JSON data describing interface structure and behavior rather than code. Client applications then render the UI using local safe component libraries based on this data. This approach ensures security, cross-platform universality, and supports dynamic UI updates, applicable to scenarios like intelligent form generation, visual Q&A, and enterprise workflows.
