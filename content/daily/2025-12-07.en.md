> `AI Daily Brief`

### **Summary**

```
Grok 4.20 reportedly profited in a U.S. stock trading contest by leveraging real-time social data, while Gemini 3 can generate AR-grade interactive 3D effects.
New data suggests AI usage is shifting toward agentic reasoning, with open-source models rising fast and already taking ~30% of traffic.
NVIDIA open-sourced a new “small model orchestrates big models” paradigm that is cheaper yet performs strongly on benchmarks.

### **Today's AI News**

1. **Gemini 3 can generate AR-grade interactive 3D particle effects from text**: Researchers demonstrated that **Gemini 3** can generate real-time interactive **3D particle effects** from simple text prompts without any coding. Users can control particle scaling and diffusion via camera-captured gestures, delivering an **AR-like** experience. The result showcases **Gemini Canvas**, which lowers the barrier for complex interactive 3D creation through built-in real-time rendering and code-fix assistance. The article contrasts Canvas—aimed at “**one-shot delivery**” of runnable front-end apps—with developer-oriented **AI Studio**, which provides ultra-long context and API debugging for enterprise builds.

2. **Grok 4.20 wins a real-money U.S. stock contest by using real-time X data**: In the **Alpha Arena 1.5** two-week U.S. stock live-trading competition hosted by nof1.ai, xAI’s previously undisclosed **Grok 4.20** reportedly was the **only** top model to turn a profit—growing a $10,000 stake to **$12,193** (**+12.11%**) while GPT-5.1, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and others lost money. The key advantage cited is Grok’s ability to access **X’s real-time full data stream**, allowing it to capture **market sentiment** and make timely decisions—for example, trading leveraged positions based on retail discussion momentum.

3. **ToolOrchestra: NVIDIA + HKU propose an 8B “conductor” to orchestrate tools and larger models**: Researchers from NVIDIA and the University of Hong Kong introduced **ToolOrchestra**, a paradigm that fine-tunes an 8B model (**Orchestrator-8B**) as a “**conductor**” to intelligently orchestrate multiple tools—such as code interpreters, web search, and stronger models like GPT-5. The system uses **reinforcement learning** optimized for correctness, cost efficiency, and user preferences, while reducing bias common in multi-agent systems. Experiments show the 8B orchestrator can outperform GPT-5 on complex benchmarks such as HLE with significantly lower compute cost. Code, models, and data are fully **open-sourced**.

4. **OpenRouter report: 100T-token real-world data shows major 2025 AI trends**: A deep report based on **OpenRouter**’s real-world **100 trillion tokens** highlights key trends: **coding** and **roleplay** dominate usage, with coding exceeding 50% of total traffic and roleplay accounting for 52% of open-source model traffic. **Open-source models** are rising fast, reaching **~30%** traffic share, with Chinese models like **DeepSeek** and **Qwen** contributing heavily. The center of gravity is shifting from text generation to **agentic reasoning**—reasoning-optimized models now exceed 50% of traffic. Regionally, **Asia’s paid usage doubled** to 31%, and **Chinese** became the world’s second-largest AI interaction language. The report also proposes a “**glass slipper effect**”: retention depends on whether a new model perfectly solves a specific pain point at launch, while data suggests **mid-sized models** are becoming mainstream.

5. **Alibaba releases Qwen3-TTS with multi-language and multi-voice support**: Alibaba introduced the new **Qwen3-TTS** multilingual, multi-voice speech synthesis model, emphasizing improved naturalness and prosody control. It supports **49 high-quality voices** across genders, ages, and character traits, plus **10 languages** (including Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean) and **9 Chinese dialects** such as Cantonese and Sichuanese. On multilingual TTS benchmarks, Qwen3-TTS reportedly achieves lower **word error rate (WER)** than popular alternatives like MiniMax and ElevenLabs.

6. **Tencent launches Hunyuan 2.0 (Tencent HY2.0) with 256K context and stronger reasoning**: **Tencent** released its in-house foundation model **Hunyuan 2.0 (Tencent HY2.0)**, now available in AI-native apps like Yuanbao and ima and via Tencent Cloud APIs. It uses a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture and supports a **256K** context window. Compared with the previous version, HY2.0 significantly improves in math, science, code, and instruction following, performing strongly on benchmarks such as IMO-AnswerBench and SWE-bench. Tencent is also progressively integrating **DeepSeek V3.2** into its ecosystem.
