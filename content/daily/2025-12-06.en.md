### **Today's AI News**

1. **EU opens antitrust investigation into Meta over WhatsApp AI access restrictions**: The **European Commission** formally launched an **antitrust investigation** into **Meta** after WhatsApp Business API policy changes reportedly allowed only **Meta AI** while blocking third-party general-purpose chatbots like **ChatGPT**. The EU alleges Meta is abusing **market dominance** and creating **unfair competition**. If found in violation, Meta could face fines up to **10% of global annual revenue**—roughly **$16.45B** based on 2024 revenue. Meta argues the restriction prevents system overload and says competition in AI remains robust. **OpenAI** and **Microsoft** have announced they will remove WhatsApp entry points, while the investigation outcome could force WhatsApp to **open its API** and set a **regulatory precedent** for AI policies in other super-app platforms.

2. **Kling AI launches “Subject Library” to keep characters and objects consistent in AI videos**: **Kling AI** introduced a **Subject Library** feature to address inconsistency in **AI video generation**—where characters, objects, and scenes can drift across shots. Users create a subject by uploading a small set of reference images; the system auto-completes multi-view representations and generates descriptions, giving the model a form of “memory.” During creation, users can call subjects via **“@subject-name”** to keep appearance consistent across any camera angle, and multiple subjects can interact stably in one scene. Kling also provides an optimized **official subject library** for quick reuse.

3. **2025 Global Unicorn 500 report: total valuation up 30.7%, dominated by the U.S. and China**: The **2025 Global Unicorn 500** report released in Qingdao said global unicorns reached a total valuation of **¥39.14 trillion**, up **30.71%** year-over-year.

It’s optimized for **Windows** development workflows and is integrated into tools such as **GitHub Copilot**, widely seen as a strong response to competitor **Anthropic** in the premium developer tooling space.

6. **Volcano Engine releases Doubao Speech Recognition 2.0 with multimodal understanding**: **Volcano Engine** launched **Doubao Speech Recognition Model 2.0**, improving inference and accuracy in complex scenarios and adding **multimodal understanding**—combining text and image context to reduce recognition errors.
