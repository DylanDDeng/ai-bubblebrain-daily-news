### **Today's AI News**

1. **Zhipu AI released ZCode**, a desktop visual AI coding environment aimed at reducing the barrier created by CLI-only AI coding tools. Key features include full CLI visualization, multi-model integration, conversational versioning, MCP protocol support, built-in collaborative agents, and one-click onboarding. The tool targets indie developers, frontend engineers, and technical PMs, aiming to make AI coding part of daily workflows.

2. **Tongyi Lab shipped Qwen Code v0.5.0**, signaling a shift from a single CLI assistant to an end-to-end developer ecosystem. Upgrades include multi-tool orchestration, stronger engineering-context understanding, and ecosystem building. The update positions Qwen against global competitors while optimizing for Chinese developer habits and stacks.

3. **Yuanbao published its 2025 annual report based on the Hunyuan model**. Over 70% of user requests choose the "fast thinking" mode, while "deep thinking" is used for complex tasks. Multimodal upgrades include multi-image understanding, image-to-image, text-to-image with text, low-latency voice calls via Hunyuan Voice, and new video calling.

4. **X (formerly Twitter) is now fully driven by xAI's Grok model for recommendations**. The system analyzes over 100 million posts daily, matching content to user behavior for more personalized distribution. It also filters low-quality content and aims to improve exposure for new users and smaller accounts.

5. **NVIDIA and Stanford open-sourced the NitroGen general game agent**, trained across 1,000+ games with cross-game generalization. The team released training data and model weights, and highlighted its large-scale pretraining plus fast adaptation paradigm as a potential blueprint for robotics control and autonomous driving.

6. **Tencent Yuanbao added a PC "voice recorder" feature**, letting users record or upload audio on desktop, transcribe long audio into structured text, auto-segment, summarize, and ask follow-up questions. This strengthens its productivity positioning in office scenarios.

7. **AI coding competition intensified over Christmas**, with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google launching holiday promotions like model upgrades, higher quotas, and discounts. Analysts see the fight shifting from model performance to ecosystem integration and user experience.

8. **Kuaikan Comics partnered with MiniMax to launch AI companion interactive comics**. Characters can move, speak, and remember, enabling real-time interaction and new storylines, signaling a new entertainment format in the AI era.

9. **Edge AI startup Liquid AI released the experimental open-source LFM2-2.6B-Exp**. Despite only 2.6B parameters, it performs strongly on benchmarks and shows strong instruction following, reportedly surpassing much larger models in some cases. It is optimized via pure reinforcement learning for edge devices with low memory footprints.

10. **OpenAI is rolling out a new "formatting module" for ChatGPT**, adding a rich-text editor when users write structured content like emails or blogs. The editor includes bold, italics, and lists to reduce cognitive load and improve creation flow.
