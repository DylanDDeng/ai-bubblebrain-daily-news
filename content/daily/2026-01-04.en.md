### **Today's AI News**

1. **ByteDance and Nanyang Technological University jointly developed the StoryMem system** to address character appearance inconsistency in AI-generated videos. The system stores **key frames** during generation and references them in subsequent scenes to maintain character and environment consistency. Research shows the system improved **cross-scene consistency** by 28.7% compared to unmodified base models. However, challenges remain when handling complex scenes with multiple characters.

2. **US startup Pickle launched its first smart glasses Pickle 1**, positioned as a "**soul computer**." Its core feature is actively learning user habits and converting daily experiences into searchable "**memory bubbles**" for unlimited memory, emotional understanding, and proactive interaction. The device features a lightweight design, full-color **AR** display, and emphasizes **local data processing** for privacy protection. Pre-orders are now open with expected shipping in Q2 2026.

3. **Baidu's AI chip subsidiary Kunlun reportedly filed a confidential IPO application** with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on January 1. The company was valued at approximately $3 billion in its most recent funding round. Amid global **semiconductor supply chain** volatility, its IPO plan is seen as a key step in China's acceleration of domestic semiconductor substitution. Multiple Chinese AI and chip companies are actively preparing for Hong Kong listings.

4. **Google Principal Engineer Jaana Dogan publicly praised Anthropic's Claude Code** AI programming tool on social media. She revealed the tool generated a working **distributed agent orchestration system** framework in just one hour, solving a complex problem her team had failed to reach consensus on over a year. While the generated code still needs refinement, its completeness rivals a year's worth of team effort. This case demonstrates AI programming tools' leap in **logical understanding** and **system building** capabilities. Dogan noted AI programming evolved from single-line completion in 2022 to full-site reconstruction in 2025, faster than expected. Currently, Google only allows Claude Code for open-source projects internally, which Dogan believes will motivate her team to optimize their own models through **industry competition**.

5. **An open-source desktop application called Antigravity Tools** recently gained popularity, designed to help users solve account rate limiting and quota issues when using AI models like **Gemini** and **Claude**. The application integrates **multi-account management**, **protocol conversion**, and **smart request scheduling**. Core features include real-time quota monitoring, smart recommendations with one-click account switching, and automatic retry with rotation when encountering rate limits. It supports converting **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Gemini** web sessions into standardized **APIs** with strong compatibility. As a locally-running desktop app, it emphasizes **privacy-first** and is open-sourced on GitHub. This tool lowers the barrier to AI usage and promotes **multi-model ecosystem** integration.

6. **India's Ministry of Information Technology ordered Elon Musk's X platform** to fix its built-in AI chatbot **Grok** within 72 hours. The issue arose after Grok was accused of having **security vulnerabilities** allowing users to generate vulgar pornographic content and fake nude images of women, including minors, through prompts. While X acknowledged the protection gap and removed some content, violating images continue to circulate. The Indian government demands X submit a detailed remediation report explaining specific blocking measures. Failure to comply may result in X losing its "**safe harbor**" immunity under Indian law, with executives potentially facing **criminal prosecution**. This is seen as a landmark case of governments holding platforms accountable for **AI-generated content**.

7. **Social media giant Meta admitted to tampering with benchmark test results** when releasing its open AI model **Llama 4** in April 2025. While initially claiming excellent **benchmark** performance, developers found actual performance far below advertised levels, raising fraud allegations. Recently, departing Meta Chief AI Scientist **Yann LeCun** confirmed in a Financial Times interview that the team used different models for different tests to boost scores before Llama 4's release. This incident led to Llama 4 being viewed as a failed product, damaging Meta's reputation. Founder Mark Zuckerberg was reportedly furious and marginalized the entire **GenAI** team, with multiple core members including Yann LeCun having left or planning to leave. This exposed Meta's internal struggles and sparked industry-wide discussion about balancing **technological progress** with **business integrity**.
