### **Today's AI News**

1. **Zhipu AI open-sources AutoGLM, a system that lets AI operate smartphones**: Zhipu AI has officially open-sourced the full codebase and models for its flagship project **AutoGLM**. AutoGLM is designed to let AI autonomously use smartphones—executing concrete in-app actions like a human rather than merely answering questions. The system provides **device-agent capabilities**, enabling it to understand interfaces, take actions, perceive feedback, and keep learning. Zhipu says the open-source release is meant to accelerate industry co-building, return data and privacy control to users, and catalyze a broader **agent ecosystem**.

2. **Runway releases GWM-1, its first “general world model”**: Runway introduced **GWM-1**, positioning it beyond image/video generation: the model aims to understand and simulate world dynamics—time, space, physics, actions, and causality—and support interaction, control, and generalization in real-time environments. The release includes three subsystems: **GWM-Worlds**, **GWM-Avatars**, and **GWM-Robotics**.

3. **Terence Tao’s group solves a 50-year-old math problem in 48 hours with AI tools**: Mathematician **Terence Tao** and collaborators reportedly solved the long-standing math problem **Erdős #1026** within 48 hours by combining multiple AI tools, including Harmonic’s math AI model **“Aristotle”**, **AlphaEvolve**, and **ChatGPT Pro**. The effort highlights a growing “**human + human + AI**” collaboration pattern for tackling complex math problems.

4. **Google releases Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for real-time voice interaction**: Google released **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio**, optimized for low-latency voice interaction. It can directly generate natural speech output for real-time conversations with more natural prosody. Key capabilities include smarter function calling, stronger instruction understanding, and a first-time feature: continuous **speech-to-speech real-time translation**.

5. **Google applies Gemini to Google Translate and launches voice-to-voice translation beta**: Google announced it is integrating **Gemini** into **Google Translate** to improve translation naturalness, accuracy, and context understanding. For voice translation, Google introduced a Gemini-powered **voice-to-voice translation** beta: users can hear translations in real time through headphones while retaining tone and emotion.

6. **Mistral AI launches Devstral 2 open-source coding models (123B and 24B)**: European AI company **Mistral AI** released the **Devstral 2** open-source coding family, including a **123B** flagship model and a **24B** lightweight variant. The flagship achieved **72.2** on **SWE-bench Verified**, with performance approaching top closed-source coding models.

7. **OPPO ColorOS to ship “AI Miaoting” that turns articles into two-host podcasts**: OPPO ColorOS will launch a new feature called **“AI Miaoting”** in December. It lets users convert articles into a two-host podcast format with background music, aiming to make content consumption more vivid and engaging.

8. **Skywork launches mobile app v5.0 with multi-agent parallel collaboration**: Chinese foundation model **Skywork** released its mobile app **v5.0**, bringing **multi-agent parallel collaboration** to phones. With a single voice command, the system can spin up multiple specialized agents to generate content in parallel—key-point summaries, to-do lists, mind maps, PPT slides, and more.

9. **Ant open-sources LLaDA2.0: a 100B-parameter discrete diffusion language model**: Ant’s research institute open-sourced the **LLaDA2.0** series, described as the first discrete diffusion LLM at the **100B-parameter** scale. With a new training strategy, it reportedly maintains high generation quality while delivering **2.1× faster inference** than comparable autoregressive models.

10. **Medeo AI updates its video generation tool with an agent architecture**: AI video tool **Medeo AI** released a new version built around an **agent architecture**, enabling real-time, unlimited edits through natural-language commands—such as adding/removing shots or adjusting scripts—significantly increasing creative flexibility.

11. **Broadcom CEO: Anthropic placed $21B in Google TPU orders**: During an earnings call, Broadcom’s CEO said the company received **$21B** in orders from AI company **Anthropic** for Google’s **TPUs**, expected to be delivered by the end of **2026**. Anthropic reportedly plans to massively expand its AI infrastructure, targeting deployment of **1 million TPUs** by 2026.
