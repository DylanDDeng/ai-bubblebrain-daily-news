### **Today's AI News**

1. **OpenAI removes the equity vesting cliff for new hires**: To stay competitive in the talent market and encourage employees to take bigger bets, **OpenAI** has reportedly eliminated the vesting “cliff” for new hires. Previously, employees needed to work at least six months before receiving their first equity grant. The move is intended to reduce anxiety about being laid off before vesting. Reports also note OpenAI’s **equity compensation** expense this year could reach roughly **$6B**, nearly half of its expected revenue.

2. **Adobe brings Photoshop, Acrobat, and Express into ChatGPT**: **Adobe** announced it is integrating **Photoshop**, **Acrobat**, and **Express** directly into the **ChatGPT** interface. Users can now edit images and documents via simple text instructions—such as customizing photos, designing invitations, or updating a PDF resume—without needing advanced professional skills. Users enable the feature by connecting the relevant apps in ChatGPT settings.

3. **Shenzhen Metro pilots an AI “guide dog” device for visually impaired riders**: Shenzhen Metro launched a pilot at the Huangmugang transit hub for an AI assistant device nicknamed **“Xiaosuan” (小蒜)**, described as the first such product in global rail transit. It supports **voice commands** for **route planning**, **obstacle avoidance**, **facility recognition**, and **auto return-to-base**. The initial rollout covers the non-paid area outside fare gates with staff support, with plans to expand to more stations.

4. **Tnkr.ai: a “GitHub for robotics” aiming to streamline robot development**: Robotics platform **Tnkr.ai** aims to solve fragmentation across hardware, software, data, and AI models in robot R&D. It consolidates these into a unified **workspace**, supporting open collaboration, real-time AI documentation generation, cross-platform tool integration, and interactive 3D visualization. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry and create a closed-loop workflow from design and coding to data feedback.

5. **DeepMind co-founder predicts 50% chance of “minimal AGI” by 2028**: **DeepMind** co-founder **Shane Legg** estimated a 50% probability of reaching “**minimal AGI**” by **2028**—defined as an AI system that can perform most common human cognitive tasks. He suggested that “full AGI” (covering the full range of human cognition) could follow within three to six years after that, and proposed a broader testing framework to assess AI progress.

6. **OpenAI: Sora Android app shipped in 28 days with 85% code from GPT-5.1-Codex**: **OpenAI** shared details of how it built the **Sora** Android app: reportedly **85% of the code** was generated by **GPT-5.1-Codex**, and the app went from prototype to global launch in **28 days** with a core team of **four engineers**. The team said they manually defined architecture and wrote specification documents to steer the model, highlighting the role of AI in **cross-platform code translation** and accelerating development.

7. **WeChat Input Method iOS 3.0 beta upgrades voice input with dialect support**: **WeChat Input Method** for iOS started testing version **3.0.0**, focusing on voice input improvements. It adds native support for Chinese, English, and multiple Chinese **dialects**, with automatic detection and transcription. The update also removes voice input **time limits**, adds “voice standby” settings for faster access, and signals a shift from basic input tooling toward a large-model-powered voice interaction experience.

8. **Grok faces renewed trust concerns after errors in breaking news responses**: **xAI’s Grok** drew criticism for major factual errors when answering questions about a breaking incident at Australia’s Bondi Beach. Reports say it repeatedly misidentified individuals, produced **irrelevant geopolitical accusations** when users uploaded images, and mixed details across different events—sometimes inserting the incident into unrelated queries. The episode highlights persistent challenges in handling **real-time news** and **fact-checking**, and raises further **trust** concerns.
