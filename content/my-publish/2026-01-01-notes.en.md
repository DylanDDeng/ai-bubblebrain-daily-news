Claude Code has become a classic agent workflow in 2025. Learning how to use it is important. This series starts from scratch and records how to get going with Claude Code.

## Prerequisites

Before using Claude Code, you need a Claude subscription or access to the Anthropic API. If you cannot use Claude, you can use Chinese providers that integrate with Claude Code, such as Zhipu or Kimi.

We will write a separate post on using Claude Code with different Chinese models.

> If you use a Claude subscription, the Pro plan is not enough. You need at least the 100 USD tier. The 20 USD tier on Codex and some Chinese providers is more cost effective.

We will continue using Claude models in this series.
