Hi everyone,

It feels like Gemini 3 is getting closer every day.

Yesterday afternoon I was browsing X and saw this:

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114005714786.png)

It said Gemini 3 could already be accessed via Canvas on mobile.

But no one knows whether it is Gemini 3 Pro or Gemini 3 Flash.

I tried it on Canvas. I cannot guarantee it is Gemini 3, but the output is seriously impressive.

It is clearly stronger than the current Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Here are a few cases I tested.

## SVG

My view on SVG tests:

It does not fully represent model capability, but it is a clear visual way to show model quality.

Here is a SVG example:

```
SVG Animation of nintendo switch playing pokemon
```

Honestly, this is the most impressive case I have seen.

Compare with Claude 4.5 Sonnet:

And GPT-5.1 Thinking:

The difference is huge.

Another frequent test is an Xbox controller SVG. After testing many models, only the unreleased Gemini 3 does it best.

```
Draw a svg of xbox controller
```

Compare with Claude 4.5 Sonnet:

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114014506136.png)

I suspect Gemini 3 is in a league of its own for SVGs.

Beyond SVG, overall front end aesthetics also improved a lot.

## Web design

A simple case, ask it to introduce itself:

```
Write a html page to introduce yourself including model name, knowledge cutoff date
```

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114015531490.png)

The impressive part is that I did not specify colors or style, but Gemini still produced a strong result.

Using the same prompt on Claude shows the gap.

Another web design example:

```
Generate a website for 5090 gpu
```

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-14%20at%2007.50.43%402x.png)

The data is correct, and the color palette matches Nvidia even though I did not specify it.

A MacOS recreation example:

The terminal command effect is especially impressive.

A high end design style example:

```
Try a new version with not gradients and super super high end and beautiful, unique and modern design
```

<figure>
  <video controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/media/video-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support video playback.
  </video>
  <figcaption>Video 1: Gemini 3 high end interaction demo</figcaption>
</figure>

The same prompt on Claude Sonnet 4.5:

<figure>
  <video controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/media/video-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support video playback.
  </video>
  <figcaption>Video 2: Claude Sonnet 4.5 comparison</figcaption>
</figure>

Claude looks good too, but the interaction animation gap is still noticeable.

## Creative writing

When I tested Web Arena, some people asked about Gemini 3 writing quality. I tested it in Canvas too.

A simple case:

```
Write a passage that is impressive enough to wow me
```

It is an open prompt.

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114082245166.png)

Now compare with Claude, which is also strong in writing.

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114082435858.png)

I personally prefer Claude here. The topic is easier to follow, while the Google one feels more abstract.

Another case: literary translation.

```
Translate this line in the writing style of Eileen Chang: Love is like a war: easy to begin but very hard to stop. Only one version, no extra explanation.
```

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114084312769.png)

Note: I used Canvas but it did not explicitly show the model, so I cannot guarantee this is the stronger model.

Now Claude:

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251114084509690.png)

I prefer Gemini for this translation. I asked GPT-5.1 to judge and it also picked Gemini.

Gemini 2.5 was already decent at writing, so the improvement might not be immediately obvious.

## Final note

Please release Gemini 3 soon, Google.
