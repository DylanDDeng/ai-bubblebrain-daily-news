In the previous post, we covered how to install Claude Code. This one focuses on common commands.

## Check the version

```
claude --version
```

This command shows whether your Claude Code version is up to date.

## MCP

```
claude mcp list
```

Skills are getting the spotlight, but MCP is still a key way to access external services. The command above shows which MCP services Claude Code is connected to.

Many MCP services now support one line setup. For example, I often use `chrome-devtools-mcp` to pair with Claude Code for web automation tasks like content scraping.

One line setup:

```
claude mcp add chrome-devtools npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

If you plan to use MCP, I strongly recommend reading each MCP repo. Most repos explain how to configure different coding agents.

## Diagnostics

```
claude doctor
```

This command shows Claude Code diagnostics.

## YOLO mode

This mode is risky. Think carefully before using it.

```
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```
