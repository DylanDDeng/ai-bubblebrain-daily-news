Gemini 3 is finally out.

I do not want to do clickbait, but I still want to say it.

This is the real global top tier model.

It is rare to see a model this anticipated. Weeks before launch, rumors were everywhere, and the whole AI community was buzzing.

From benchmarks alone, it is basically sweeping the charts.

Across 20 benchmarks, it beats Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.1 on 19 of them. The only one where it trails slightly is SWE-Bench Verified, a coding task.

So what magic did Anthropic use on Claude

But across 20 benchmarks, covering multimodal images, video, math, tool use, reasoning, code, and long context, it does not just do one thing. It is both broad and extremely strong.

On LM Arena, it ranks first on almost every major list.

Text, vision, web dev, code, math all rank first by a wide margin.

They also shipped an IDE alongside Gemini 3 called AntiGravity.

You can tell they are confident.

I had tested Gemini 3 twice during the early leak phase, and it was already impressive. This time I wanted to share a few different cases.

## Hands-on tests

### SVG

Static SVG tasks are easy for Gemini 3 now. You can get animated SVGs quickly.

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-19%20at%2002.51.34.gif)

This works well for educational snippets. For example, a washing machine animation:

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-19%20at%2003.06.00.gif)

The prompt I used was fairly complex, but it nailed it.

I also asked it to generate a 360 degree draggable MacBook Pro SVG animation.

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-19%20at%2003.16.54.gif)

It even drew the Apple logo and the MacBook Pro notch, plus the signature space gray finish. The details are wild.

### Web design

The biggest improvement in Gemini 3 is front end web design quality, especially overall aesthetics.

```
Try a new version with not gradients and super super high end and beautiful, unique and modern design
```

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-19%20at%2003.44.44.gif)

This looks amazing.

Another example:

```
Creat an esthetic website for criminal minds characters.
```

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-19%20at%2003.56.05.gif)

A high end website from a single prompt is no longer a dream.

On the multimodal side, Gemini 3 is also very strong. For example, it is much easier to do UI replication.

I fed it a screenshot of the Bilibili homepage and asked it to recreate it.

```
Use HTML, CSS, JS to recreate the Bilibili homepage
```

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/20251119042208626.png)

Aside from the cover images, it reproduced almost everything.

Here is a cyber style knowledge card using Gemini 3 official docs as content.

```
1. Objective

Build a cyberpunk interactive infographic focused on user provided content. Emphasize dynamic visuals and luminous UI.

2. Core Theme and Style

Theme: AI, virtual city, future economy.
Style: flicker, sharp, glowing.
Key aesthetics: neon lines and grid matrix, layered glass UI.
Secondary: dynamic particles and gradient flow to suggest energy.

3. Layout and Structure
- Top area with logo and system status bar, time, battery, connection.
- Main area with three rows of cards, stats panel, comparison analysis, conclusion visualization.
- Each card has hover highlight and fade in animation.
- Footer includes a neon outlined CTA button and copyright.

4. Design Elements and Visual Details
- Background gradient from deep blue to purple, #05091a to #1a1245.
- Primary colors: electric blue #3b82f6, neon purple #a855f7, acid green #84cc16.
- Glow effects, inner shadows, glass blur with backdrop-filter.
- Fonts: Orbitron or Roboto Mono.
- Line animation with keyframes for breathing light.
- Minimal corner radius and strong geometry.

5. Final Delivery

Single file HTML with a small amount of embedded CSS animation. Focus on presenting user content and visual motion with a futuristic atmosphere.
```

Looks great, and it pulled out the key information.

### Video understanding

My favorite Gemini capability is video understanding. It is ahead of other models.

The most direct test is to generate a knowledge card from a video.

> Test video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emWgP_fr04k

![](https://image-1325800846.cos.ap-nanjing.myqcloud.com/CleanShot%202025-11-19%20at%2004.51.07%402x.png)

What is impressive is that it not only extracts key content, but also identifies main characters and links back to the source video.

The context window is huge. This video is over 40 minutes, and Gemini handled it without issues.

Another common scenario is breaking down short drama episodes.

The prompt is long so I will not include it here. If you are interested, DM me.

The video here is episode 1 of the short drama Peach Blossom Horse, Please Take the Spear.

<video controls preload="metadata">
  <source src="/my-publish/1(3).mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support video playback. You can download it here: <a href="/my-publish/1(3).mp4">1(3).mp4</a>
</video>

Below is Gemini 3 Pro output so you can see the level of detail:

          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "desc": [
          "Song Xixi looks shocked and disappointed."
        ],
        "sub_dialog": [
          {

            "text": "Do you remember you promised never to take a concubine?"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "desc": [
          "Zhan Beiwang looks indifferent and impatient."
        ],
        "sub_dialog": [
          {
            "role": "Zhan Beiwang",
            "text": "Forget that. I did not understand love then. You were suitable as my wife. Then I met Ah Fang. She is different from every woman I have seen. I love her deeply."
          },
          {
            "role": "Song Xixi",
            "text": "I want to meet General Yi Fang."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

I tested this case one year ago and the results were bad. It missed content or mismatched dialogue and characters, so it was not usable.

Today, Gemini 3 does it extremely well.

## Closing thoughts

Honestly, I have never anticipated a model this much. Before, I did not know what I was waiting for. Was it a stronger model, or just benchmark hype

After testing the official release, I realized the expectation was beyond the model itself.

When the final bell rings in the temple of AI, the voice most likely to open the door to ASI may come from Google.
